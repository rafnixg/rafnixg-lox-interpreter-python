This is a starting point for Python solutions to the
["Build Your Own Build your own Interpreter" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview).

In this challenge, you'll build a simple interpreter for a custom language.
Lox is a simple language that supports variables, control flow, and functions.

**Note**: To try the challenge: [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)

# Lox Interpreter in Python

This is a Python implementation of the Lox interpreter. It is based on the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Running the interpreter

To run the interpreter, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ ./your_program.sh <path_to_lox_file>
```

For example:

```bash
$ ./your_program.sh examples/hello_world.lox
Hello, world!
```

## Supported features

Actually, the interpreter is not fully implemented.
